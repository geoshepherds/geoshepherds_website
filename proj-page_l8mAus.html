It was important however to find the balance of automated processes without compromising on quality or having to re-do work manually later. Another key decision in the planning stage was to develop a scene selection criteria in order for the final mosaic to have a visually uniform appearance. As we are always keen to utilise open-source software, we wanted to make use of good options whenever possible for the project. </p>

Proprietary software however, will have license costs associated with using it but can at times produce better outputs. This can be attributed to choices in different processing algorithms and also through thorough testing of the software. We have written a short summary for some of the key processes involved in the project discussing our decisions whether to use proprietary or open-source software. If you are looking to create an imagery mosaic of your own, you may find some of the below assessments of interest. We encourage you to look at current open-source options as they develop quickly with new functionality being made available.</p>

The ‘Advanced Digitising Toolbar’ in QGIS has additional options you can use for digitising for example splitting- , reshaping- and merging- features and is intuitive to use. You can extend digitising further in QGIS by installing some plugins.</p>
                        <p>In addition, we wanted to supply our clients with vector ancillary resources containing information about all of the scenes used in the mosaic. These were produced using a number of the tools available in the ‘Vector Processing’ menu on the cutlines generated during the mosaicing. </p>
                        <p>For a large scale mosaic, tiling the imagery is vital, in order for the imagery to be in used manageable sizes. QGIS seemed the natural option for generating tile grids as the structure for cutting up the mosaic in multiple projections. </p>

                        <p>We used GDAL for reprojecting, resampling, building overviews, clipping, tiling and formatting of all the data during the entire project.

It was probably the main workhorse for much of the processing work as it was continuously running in the background.</p>

                        <p>The main reason we chose Geomatica over open-source and other proprietary options, such as ERDAS Imagine, was due to a number of reasons. Firstly, we found during testing that the output quality was very good as a result of their algorithms and advanced processing options. Additionally, many of the tasks could also be batched using Geomatica’s Modeler for convenience and automation. Finally, the main reason for Geomatica was their very powerful OrthoEngine product that is part of Geomatica. This is where we completed all of the mosaicing and found the setup and structure of the workflow very intuitive. There are many options for various mosaicing techniques and the ability to include masks and perform manual editing was what enabled us to create a high quality mosaiced output.</p>

                        <p>One part of the process that we decided to work manually was to produce the cloud and fire scar masks for mosaicing. Automated workflows generally involve some form of pixel-based classification where the computer identifies certain pixel characteristics that would indicate for example a cloud. 
                        </p>
                        <p>We found however that working over Australia, areas with a high surface albedo(reflectance) such as beaches and urban areas were often mistaken for clouds. This resulted in the need for extensive manual editing afterwards. Therefore, in this case manual digitising from the beginning ended up being the quicker and more accurate option.</p>

We were pleased the end-result surpassed our initial goals and expectations and has prompted some new uses for the product that we had not intended initially. Technical information and sample imagery for the product can be found <a class="l8mLink" href="l8maust.html">here</a>. In addition to the mosaic, we are currently designing a collection of posters capturing the naturally beauty of Australia. Visit our <a class="l8mLink" href="store.html">store</a> to have a look at these!</p>
